1.Explain the difference between FIFO and Capacity scheduler

  There are many differences between FIFO and Capacity scheduler.They are :
         
 * In FIFO scheduling the jobs are taken from the work queue.
 * Whereas in capacity scheduling several queues are created,with each having a number of map and reduce tasks.
 *In FIFO the jobs are taken in the order of oldest job first.
 * In capacity scheduling each queue is assigned a capacity.These capacity of individual queue are added together to 
     find the overall capacity of the cluster.
 *THe FIFO scheduling does not consider the  size or the priority of the job.
 * In FIFO if the old job is longer than the short jobs then the short job gets delayed till the long ones are executed.
  *But in Capacity scheduler the shortest job are processed first followed by the longest one
 * In FIFO there is poor utilization of the job queue and it has costly data replication.

        
 2.What are the limitations of hadoop 1.x and how they were overcome in hadoop 2.x

  The limitations of hadoop 1.x are:

    * The major drawback of hadoop 1.x is that it supports only map reduce based batch and data processing.
    * Hadoop 1.x does not supports horizontal scalability.
    *Only one namenode is used in hadoop 1.x
         If the name node fails then the entire cluster will fail which is called as the Single Point of failure(SPOF). 
    * Hadoop 1.x is not suitable for real time data processing.

          
  Hadoop 2.x overcomes the limitation of hadoop 1.x by:

   * Haddop 2.x maks use of  new YARN component.
   * Hadoop 2.x provides high availability and high scalability.  
   * Hadoop 2.x supports horizontal scalability which is not supported in hadoop 1.x.
   * Hadoop 2.x supports the use of  multiple namenode and multiple name space.
   * Hadoop 2.x includes several components such as resource manager component, node manager component and
     application master component which helps it to overcome the limitations of hadoop 1.x.
  * Hadoop 2.x decouples the mapreduce components responsibility into different components.
